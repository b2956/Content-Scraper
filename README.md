# Content-Scraper

Imagine you work for a price comparison website. Youâ€™ve been given the task to create a Node.js command line application that goes to an ecommerce site to get the latest prices and save them to a spreadsheet (CSV format). You will write the application as if the spreadsheet will be used by another application to populate a database. The application you build will run once every day. You should use npm modules to assist you in the project. You have to research and use npm packages that will help you scrape a website and create a CSV file.

# Instructions
1) "npm install" to install all dependencies
2) "node scraper.js" or "npm start" to run the program
